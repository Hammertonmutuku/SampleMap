   <h1>SAMPLE 1</h1>
   <p>Unlike what we thought earlier the link that you sent me earlier is an imag of a map not an actual map. <br>From that image you then segment it and add the interactive part of it such that if one hovers over it chnages color and also becomes a link to another page of the website <br> in which you will fill a detailed image map of the area you clicked on. <br>
   As this is just but a demo i may have not maped out some areas but most of them are working.</p>

<p>Note: Its not the best of work but more of a back end project to show the functionality<br>
The first sample can be well traced to fit the sub counties and also the color codes to match the website design<br>
Don't know if the client will still want the toggle functionality but i discovered a simpler way, once you hover over the sub counties you will see names, we can put both the name and the zip code there.
